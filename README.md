# NEAT-AI
Introduction:

This repo is a tutorial repo meant to be seen as a educational resource on the AI created by Kenneth O. Stanley. 
I remade a simple version of the classic mobile game "Flappy Bird" with the intention of using a Neural Network to master the game.

Goal:

To learn and interact with python AI frameworks and to create a successful Neural Network Flappy Bird intance.

Structure:

One output node: Jump or no Jump
Four input nodes: X position, y position, position of top pipe and position of bottom pipe
